# imdb-scraper
scrapes imdb using omdb api

## how to use it
1. enter your api key in the `apiKey` constant located at [`scraper.js`](https://github.com/aymey/imdb-scraper/blob/main/scraper.js#L4)
2. enter IMDB movie ID's into the `movies` file located at `.` delimited by a newline character
3. run with `node scraper.js`
4. watch as it fills `output.tsv` with all fields from omdb in the default order in tsv format

I suggest going into [`scraper.js`](https://github.com/aymey/imdb-scraper/blob/main/scraper.js) and removing the unneeded fields because it uses all available fields by default

Also if you need a list of movie names you can go [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) and download [title.basic.tsv.gz](https://datasets.imdbws.com/title.basics.tsv.gz), decompress it using `gunzip`, isolate "tconst" column using `cat title.basics.tsv | cut -f 1 > movies`, and run from there.

## dependencies
Aswell as obviously depending on Node, imdb-scraper depends on `axios` and file system (`fs`): use `npm install axios` to install.
